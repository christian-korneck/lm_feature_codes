lm_feature_codes
===========

CSV list of floating license server feature codes (i.e. FlexLM, RLM) and their human-readable descriptions for various vendors (i.e. Autodesk, Foundry). Primarily focused on DCC/VFX/CGI/2D/3D/CAD software. Meant as a dictionary to translate rather cryptic lm feature codes to their product names, i.e. for better license monitoring or inventory.

After Autodesk's recent [license model change](https://www.autodesk.com/products/perpetual-licenses), the description for most Autodesk Packages indicates whether the package is `perpetual` or `rental`.
